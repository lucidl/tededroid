# Tededroid
This application is a successor of a Tedegraph app and is written in Java.
It should help you to read webpages with a larger amount of text.
The articles are presented gradually next to the picture which may help with understanding sentences.
The app may help with various reading difficulties (e.g. problem with focus and dyslexia).

You may create your own learning and presentation material manually and copy them to the app folder.

Don't forget to download the file en-sent.bin from https://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/ and
put it in the Tededroid\app\src\main\assets directory.

The icon (and picture of a hamster) was created with the assistance of DALLÂ·E.
